   QUESTION 1:  ...............................

javac StructData.java
java  StructData


Pros: The Java version of C-style struct provides a straightforward way to group related data fields into a single object, enhancing code organization and readability. It mimics the familiar syntax of C struct, allowing for easy porting of C-style code to Java.

Cons: Unlike in C, where structs can have member functions and pointers to structs, the Java version lacks such capabilities. Additionally, direct access to fields in Java may lead to less encapsulation and potentially compromise data integrity.



     QUESTION 2:    ................................

simply run the code by

javac FruitEnums.java
java FruitEnums

The Java version of enums provides type safety and convenience, ensuring compile-time checking of enum values. By encapsulating constants within classes, it overcomes the shortcomings of C enums, offering improved readability and maintainability. This approach enhances code organization and clarity while retaining the benefits of enumerated types.



QUESTION  3:  ...............................................

simply run the code terminal as

javac Union.java
java Union



The Java version of unions, achieved through enums and abstract classes, effectively provides type safety and clarity in code. It allows for representing multiple types under a single variable, enhancing code organization and readability. However, unlike traditional unions, it doesn't support storing different types of data in the same memory location, which can be a limitation in certain scenarios.
